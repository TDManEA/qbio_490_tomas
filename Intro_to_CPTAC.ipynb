Thus, cases in which ERBB2 is overexpressed are referred to as HER2+.

    "# Answer to questions here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The numbers within the DataFrames represent log2 fold change, which is useful in determining under/over-expression—where positive values are overexpression and negative values are underexpression.\n",
    "2. There are fewer columns in the protein DataFrame because most genes are not protein coding—relative to the transcriptomics one.\n",
    "3. The central dogma revolves around DNA being transcribed to RNA and then translated into proteins. Mutations disrupt both processes, in turn yielding different transcriptional regulators and epigenome that impacts expression: either positively or negatively.\n",
    "4. Proteomics is more labor-intensive than sequencing data, therefore it costs more, making it more scarce in data sets.\n",
    "5. Never expect protein expression to be 0 because CPTAC is oriented to always have a mix of many cells' proteins, suggesting that there will always be a given quantity of protein—regardless of a specific cell's inability to create protein.\n",
    "6. Protein domains are the functional structures central to a protein. Within peptide sequences, one can idenitfy where protein domains are located and see if there are mutations in said region.\n",
    "7. ERBB2 is a oncogene, meaning that mutations in this type of gene leads to a proliferation in cancerous cells (throguh converting the cell into a cancerous one, occuring via mutation). Treatments include HER2-targeted cell therapy and a potential experimental treatment that mimic antibody chemical conjugates for \"HER2-low\". Lastly, the new development in our understanding of HER2+ breast cancer is HER2-positive carcinomas can deter the proper identification of anti-HER2 agents."
